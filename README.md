## Overview
This is another javascript project specially created to practice fetch requests and consuming an API. On this time I chose an app that makes requests and shows information according to the user's input. 
Basically consist in an app for searching the historical standings of different football leagues.
 
### The challenge
I built the app app-lying concepts of HTML/CSS/JS. I had to think how to do the differents features that I wanted to implement and I learned about requesting and handling information from the API.

## My process
I've chosen the idea by myself while I was looking for API's to consume. Then I looked for the Football API so I thought I would make a page with the standings of different leagues because it's something that I searched multiple times in the past and sometimes it's not easy to get this data so I made a simple web with this unique purpose. I added different leagues and seasons for filter.

### Built with

- Desktop first workflow
- Responsive design
- Flexbox concepts
- Control version system using Git
- JavaScript vanilla

### What I learned
In this project I learned more than the previous and that's important. I worked with real API's and I understood more about how to manage it. Then I used more async functions to display the info and handle the different functions of the app.
It was a challenge to make everything work well but I started with an idea and I was be able to get it. I'll keep working and improving on it.

### Continued development
I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially more about javascript in order to create dynamic webs and amazing web-experiences.
